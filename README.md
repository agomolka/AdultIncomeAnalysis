# Adult Income Analysis
Prediction whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. 

I collected the data from the UCI Machine Learning repository.

### Classification Models Used:

* Decision Tree
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forests
* k-Nearest Neighbours
* Support Vector Machine

My analysis show that *Marital status*, *Relationship* and *Capital Gain* have the biger importance in income prediction.
